> More coming soon! I'm porting many commands from a previous bot I created. Stay tune ðŸ˜„

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rjf2016/EZbot.git
```

After cloning, run:

```
npm install
```

### Setup

To run locally you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory. I will create an example.env file as soon as I get the chance, but until then feel you can model it off the `environement.d.ts` file.

Head to Discord [Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app - save the client token that you generate. Your .env file should look something like:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<client_token>
GUILD_ID=<your_guild_ID>
ENV=<debug|dev|prod>
```

### Run

For developing (with hot reloading) run:

```
npm run start:dev
```

To compile run:

```
npm run build && npm start:prod
```
