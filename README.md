> More coming soon! I'm porting many commands from a previous bot I created. Stay tunedðŸ˜„

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/rjf2016/EZbot.git
```

After cloning, run:

```bash
yarn # installs dependencies
```

### Setup

To run locally you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory. I will create an example.env file as soon as I get the chance, but until then feel you can model it off the `environement.d.ts` file.

Head to Discord [Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app - save the client token that you generate. Your .env file should look something like:

```
PROD_TOKEN=<client_token>
GUILD_ID=<your_guild_ID>
NODE_ENV=<production | development>
```

### Run

For developing (with hot reloading) run:

```bash
yarn dev # start typescript server & use dev config
```

To compile and run:

```bash
yarn build # builds javascript source files

yarn start # starts dist/index.js
```
